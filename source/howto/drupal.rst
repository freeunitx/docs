      }

   .. warning::

      The order of these routes matters.  Keep the **share** action last.
      The steps above are what keep PHP files from reaching it: the first
      **return: 404** hides configuration and library files, and the second
      rejects every **.php** URI other than **/index.php**.  The
      **/index.php** and **/index.php/\*** entries of the **direct** step
      run the bare path and its PATH_INFO forms as PHP.  Without them the
      request reaches the **share** instead, which returns the source of
      **index.php** (see the **types** warning above).  If you reorder
      these steps, or add a "static files first"
      **share** ahead of them, a request for
      **/sites/default/settings.php** returns the file verbatim with your
      database password in the body.

      Drupal's PHP also lives in **.module**, **.inc**, **.install**,
      **.theme** and **.profile** files.  In the configuration above the
      first **return: 404** step denies them on the URI.  That step does the
      work, not **types**: a configuration that drops the deny list and
      relies on **types** alone serves all five as source.

      A **types** allow-list on the trailing **share** is a safety net, not
      a replacement for this order.  A request the list refuses takes the
      share's **fallback**, **applications/drupal/index**, which is where a
      non-static path belongs.  It does not resume routing at the next step,
      so **types** on a **share** placed earlier would stop
      **/core/install.php** and **/update.php** from reaching the **direct**
      target.

   .. warning::

      The case caveat in the warning before the configuration is not
      limited to PHP.  Every pattern in a **uri** array is matched the same
      way, so the deny list above misses **/core/composer.JSON**,
      **/WEB.CONFIG**, an uppercase **.YML** and the rest; the trailing
      **share** then serves them.  The list is not
      uniformly lowercase either: **\*/Entries\***, **\*/Repository**,
      **\*/Root**, **\*/Tag** and **\*/Template** are capitalised, and
      those five match only that exact spelling — a lowercase **/cvs/root**
      is not denied.

      The dependable fix is to keep the document root on a case-sensitive
      filesystem, which is what a Linux production host gives you by
      default.  Unit has no per-route case-insensitivity switch: closing the
      gap in the configuration means replacing each glob with a regular
      expression, for example ``"~(?i)\\.php$"`` in place of ``"*.php"``,
      and doing that for one pattern only moves the exposure to the other
      31.  Rewriting all of them is an option, but treat the caveat, not the
      **.php** entry, as the thing to act on.

      This configuration comes from the upstream Unit documentation, which is
      archived and no longer updated, so copies of it in the wild still carry
      the original claim that the rule denies "any PHP scripts".  See
      `freeunit#323 <https://github.com/freeunitorg/freeunit/issues/323>`__.

   Unit does not read **.htaccess**.  The **response_headers** option on the
   **share** action above replaces its **ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"**
   rule.  Without it, a site moved from Apache serves every static file
   without **Cache-Control**, and the one-year cache time is lost.  The option
   applies only to the files the **share** serves.  A request that takes the
   **fallback** is handled by the **fallback** action, so responses from
   **index.php** do not get the header, which matches the **ExpiresActive
   Off** rule for **.php** files in **.htaccess**.

   .. note::

      The difference between the **pass** targets is their usage of
      the **script** :ref:`setting <configuration-php>`:

      - The **direct** target runs the **.php** script from the
        URI or **index.php** if the URI omits it.

      - The **index** target specifies the **script** that Unit
        runs for *any* URIs the target receives.

************************
Cron and background work
************************

Applies to |app| 10 and later.  Two different code paths reach the same
result, so the version only changes which one you read.

From 11.4, |app| starts up through `symfony/runtime
<https://github.com/symfony/runtime>`__.  Its **HttpKernelRunner** sends the
response.  Then it calls `fastcgi_finish_request() <https://www.php.net/manual/function.fastcgi-finish-request.php>`__.  Only after that does it
call **$kernel->terminate()**.  See `drupal.org #3313404
<https://www.drupal.org/i/3313404>`__.

On |app| 10 and 11.0-11.3, **index.php** calls **$response->send()** and then
**$kernel->terminate()**.  **Response::send()** calls
**fastcgi_finish_request()** itself when that function exists, and the PHP
module provides it.

Either way, anything a module does in the terminate phase runs after the client
already has its response.

What this means on Unit
=======================

.. note::

   Unit 1.37.0 fixes this (`freeunit#405
   <https://github.com/freeunitorg/freeunit/pull/405>`__).  The process now
   tells the router that it is still running after
   **fastcgi_finish_request()**.  The router counts it as busy until the job
   ends, so it counts against **processes.max** and the idle reaper does not
   stop it.  The rest of this section describes 1.36.1 and earlier.

Unit's PHP module implements **fastcgi_finish_request()**.  When PHP calls it,
the module tells the router that the request is complete, and PHP goes on
running.  Up to 1.36.1, two things follow.  Both were observed:

- The router counts the process as idle, so **processes.max** reports more
  capacity than you really have.

- The idle clock for the process starts.  The idle reaper
  (**idle_timeout**, default 15 seconds) can then send **QUIT** to the process
  and remove it while the job is still running.

The job itself still finishes, because Unit cannot interrupt a PHP script.  But
a request that is already queued to that process can end up with no process to
serve it, and Unit starts no replacement.  This was observed, not derived: in
one measurement such a request ran about 300 seconds later, when other traffic
started the application again.  It was tracked as `issue #321
<https://github.com/freeunitorg/freeunit/issues/321>`__, which also records the
conditions of that measurement.

Such a request waits; it does not fail.  No 503 arrived in that measurement.
Unit starts **limits.timeout** when it hands a request to a process.  A
request that is still waiting for a process has no timer running.
Note also that this option defaults to 0, which starts no timer at all.

.. _howto-drupal-automated-cron:

The **automated_cron** module
=============================

A stock |app| install enables **automated_cron**.  This module runs cron in the
terminate phase of a random visitor's request, at most once every **10800**
seconds (3 hours).  Core's cron service raises the time limit for that run to
240 seconds (**Environment::setTimeLimit(240)** in
**core/lib/Drupal/Core/Cron.php**).  With **"processes": {"max": 1}**, the site
is down for as long as the run takes.

Uninstall **automated_cron**, or set its interval to 0, and run cron outside
the request:

.. code-block:: console

   $ drush cron

Run this from a systemd timer or from system cron.  Handle queues the same way,
with **drush queue:run**.

Opcache and idle processes
==========================

A common recommendation for PHP-FPM says to keep one process alive, because
the opcache is lost when the last process exits.  That does not apply to Unit.
The PHP module starts PHP in the application prototype
(**nxt_php_setup()** in **src/nxt_php_sapi.c**), and Unit forks every process
from that prototype.  The opcache shared memory belongs to the prototype, and
the idle reaper never removes the prototype, so the cache survives a process
exiting.  A configuration change that touches the application replaces the
prototype, and the opcache then starts cold.

So **"idle_timeout": 0** or **"spare": 1** is not needed to keep the opcache
warm.  This says nothing else about **spare**.  **"spare": 0** keeps no
process resident.  On 1.36.1 and earlier, **"spare": 0** with terminate-phase
work also has the risk that `What this means on Unit`_ describes.

If cron must stay in-request
============================

On 1.36.1 and earlier, two settings make the problem smaller.  From 1.37.0
on, they are not needed for this problem:

- **"spare": 1** keeps one process warm.  The idle reaper then never looks at
  the last idle process.

- An **idle_timeout** longer than the slowest job.

Treat both as mitigations, not guarantees.  They come from a single observation
in a run that was measuring something else.  No controlled test confirmed them.

**"spare": 1** has a measured cost.  When the configuration changes, Unit logs
lines such as::

   [alert] sendmsg(...) failed (32: Broken pipe)

This is the prototype writing to a spare process that has already exited.  The
processes still exit 0 and no request is affected, so nothing breaks.  Up to
1.36.1 the line is logged at **alert** level, so it can trigger log-based
alerts.  In a run before 1.37.0 over a sample of three configuration changes,
**"spare": 1** produced such lines and **"spare": 0** produced none.  From
1.37.0 on, a **QUIT** that fails because the process already exited is logged
at **info** level (`freeunit#440
<https://github.com/freeunitorg/freeunit/pull/440>`__).

Bounding a job
==============

Use `pcntl_alarm() <https://www.php.net/manual/function.pcntl-alarm.php>`__ to bound a job.  `set_time_limit() <https://www.php.net/manual/function.set-time-limit.php>`__ does not bound it:
it does not stop a blocking sleep or a blocking I/O call.

**pcntl_alarm()** only schedules the **SIGALRM** signal.  Four things must also
be true for it to stop the job.

- The **pcntl** extension must be loaded.
- A handler must be registered with `pcntl_signal() <https://www.php.net/manual/function.pcntl-signal.php>`__.
- Signal delivery must be asynchronous, through `pcntl_async_signals(true) <https://www.php.net/manual/function.pcntl-async-signals.php>`__.
  Otherwise the handler runs only at the next tick.
- The handler must end the job itself.  A handler that returns does not stop
  anything: the job continues from where the signal interrupted it.

The third argument to **pcntl_signal()** is **restart_syscalls**.  When it is
**true**, the system resumes a call that a signal interrupted, and a blocking
call inside an extension or a database driver can run past the bound.  For
**SIGALRM** PHP already defaults it to **false**, so the example passes
**false** to state that rather than to change it.  Pass **false** explicitly
for any other signal you handle this way.

Release |app|'s cron lock in the handler.  If you do not, the lock stays held
and cron is skipped for up to 900 seconds.

Cancel the alarm when the job finishes normally.  An alarm that is still
pending fires during the next request on the same process.

A complete pattern::

   pcntl_async_signals(TRUE);

   pcntl_signal(SIGALRM, function () {
     \Drupal::lock()->release('cron');
     exit(1);
   }, FALSE);

   pcntl_alarm(240);

   try {
     \Drupal::service('cron')->run();
   }
   finally {
     pcntl_alarm(0);
   }

**exit()** ends the process.  Unit starts a new one for the next request.  To
keep the process, throw from the handler instead and catch the exception
outside the **try** block above, but only if every library in the job is
exception-safe.

What happens on deploy
======================

A running job survives idle reaping, a configuration **PUT**, and **SIGTERM**
to **unitd**.  In all three cases Unit sends **QUIT** as a port message, and a
process only reads its port between requests.  Unit never turns that
message into a signal for a process that has reported that it is ready.

So a job finishes by default.  But it has no timeout and no upper limit: a
runaway job keeps an orphaned process alive for as long as it runs.  That
process does not appear in **/status**, and it is no longer part of the
configuration.  Unit does not drain background jobs on deploy.  It only never
interrupts them.

.. warning::

   **docker stop** sends **SIGTERM** and then, after a grace period of 10
   seconds by default, **SIGKILL**.  The second signal does kill a running job.

.. warning::

   On |app| 11.4 and later, the runner skips **fastcgi_finish_request()** when
   debug mode is on (**APP_DEBUG**).  The request then stops detaching, with no
   error and no log line, and the visitor waits for the terminate phase again.

   On |app| 10 and 11.0-11.3 there is no such switch.  **index.php** calls
   **$response->send()**, which calls **fastcgi_finish_request()** whenever the
   function exists.  Debug mode does not change this.  On those versions the
   terminate phase always runs after the response, so the behaviour described
   above always applies.
